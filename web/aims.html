<h1>The Practicum</h1>

<i>NYU GSAS PHYS-XXX Fall 2014</i>

<h2>Staff</h2>

<p>Prof <b>David W. Hogg</b> (NYU Physics; NYU CDS; MPI Astronomie)
<ul>
  <li><i>office:</i> 501 Meyer</li>
  <li><i>office hours:</i> TBD</li>
  <li><i>contact:</i> [send email]</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Aims</h2>

<p>This course has several aims, and components corresponding to those
aims:
<ul>
  <li>Practice teaching physics.</li>
  <li>Read key research literature on teaching and the classroom.</li>
  <li>Experience and reflect on good teaching by others.</li>
  <li>(Discuss responsible conduct of research.)</li>
</ul>
The last item is unlike the others; it is part of our grant
administration requirements at NYU.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<p>Reasonable performance in this class is a pre-requisite to being
assigned teaching positions within the Physics Department.  Reasonable
performance in the responsible conduct of research (RCR) part of this
class is a pre-requisite to being supported on any external federal
grant.  I will not grade harshly, but I will expect the following of
all students:
<ul>
  <li><b>attendance:</b> I will expect every student to come to every
  class.  If you are going to miss a class for any reason, I expect a
  good excuse to be presented to me <i>by email</i> and <i>in
  advance</i> of the missed class.  The only exceptions are medical
  excuses, which can be presented after, but once again I would like
  to get these <i>by email</i>.</li>
  <li><b>written work:</b> I will ask for written reactions to some of
  the papers we read, to the classroom visits we organize, and to some
  of the in-class presentations.  These will not have to be long, but
  I expect them to be submitted by the given deadlines, and in
  (relatively) good English.  If you have trouble with English, find
  resources to help you.  Good English is important to teaching and
  doing research in physics.</li>
</ul>
